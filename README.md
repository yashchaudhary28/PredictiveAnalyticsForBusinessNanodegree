# Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree
This program has enabled me to:

Create mental models to clearly define business issues.
Visualize and prepare data to improve efficacy of predictive models.
Identify and implement a variety of predictive modeling techniques.

This repository contains projects for Udacity's Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree.

Project 1: Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics by Alteryx
Proj 1.1: Predicting Catalog Demand
A home-goods manufacturer wants to predict expected profits from a catalog launch. The goal is to identify the required framework to work through the problem and build a linear regression model to provide results and a recommendation.

Learnings:

Structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics.
How to select the most appropriate analytical methodology.
Implement a predictive model (linear regression).

Project 2: Data Wrangling : Creating an Analytical Dataset by Alteryx
A pet store chain is selecting the location for its next store. The aim is to use data preparation techniques to build a robust analytic dataset and use it to build a predictive model to select the best location.

Project 2.1a: Data Cleanup
Project 2.1b: Predictive modeling to select the best location
You’re a business intelligence analyst for a wholesaler of various food products. You’re in charge of putting together analytics dashboards for management. They have requested that you focus on one area of the business and create a dashboard that provides various summary statistics related to that area.

Learnings:

Understand common data types and sources of data
Clean and organize a messy dataset
Identify and adjust for outliers
Summarize, cross-tabulate, transpose, and reformat data to prepare a dataset for analysis
Join and union data from different sources and formats

Project 3: Creditworthiness: Predicting Default Risk
Learnings:

Understand the fundamentals of classification modeling and how it differs from modeling numeric data.
Build logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and boosted models; use stepwise to automate predictor variables selection.
Score and compare models and interpret the results.


Project 4: A/B Test a New Menu Launch
A chain of coffee shops is considering launching a new menu. Design and analyze an A/B test and write up a recommendation on whether the chain should introduce the new menu.

Learnings:

Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including selecting target and control units and variables and the duration of a test
Randomized design : select test and control variables and understand the importance of sample size and design a randomized design A/B test and analyze the results
Matched Pair design : match test units to control units and design a matched pair design A/B test and analyze the results


Capstone Project: Segmentation and Clustering
A grocery store chain is planning a significant expansion. Use multiple analytical techniques to provide recommendations on how to expand.

Capstone Project: Predictive Analytics Capstone
Learnings:

Segmentation basics: understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation
Preparing data: scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling and select variables to include based on the business context
Variable Reduction: use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model
Clustering models: select the appropriate number of clusters; build and apply a k-centroid cluster model
Comfortable combining predictive techniques and delivering results to complex business problems
