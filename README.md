# Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree
This program has enabled me to:

> Create mental models to clearly define business issues. </br>
> Visualize and prepare data to improve efficacy of predictive models. </br>
> Identify and implement a variety of predictive modeling techniques. </br>

This repository contains projects for Udacity's Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree.

### Project 1: Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics by Alteryx

- Proj 1.1: Predicting Catalog Demand

A home-goods manufacturer wants to predict expected profits from a catalog launch. The goal is to identify the required framework to work through the problem and build a linear regression model to provide results and a recommendation. </br>

Learnings:

> Structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics. </br>
> How to select the most appropriate analytical methodology. </br>
> Implement a predictive model (linear regression). </br>

### Project 2: Data Wrangling : Creating an Analytical Dataset by Alteryx

A pet store chain is selecting the location for its next store. The aim is to use data preparation techniques to build a robust analytic dataset and use it to build a predictive model to select the best location.

- Project 2.1a: Data Cleanup
- Project 2.1b: Predictive modeling to select the best location

You’re a business intelligence analyst for a wholesaler of various food products. You’re in charge of putting together analytics dashboards for management. They have requested that you focus on one area of the business and create a dashboard that provides various summary statistics related to that area.

Learnings:

> Understand common data types and sources of data. </br>
> Clean and organize a messy dataset. </br>
> Identify and adjust for outliers. </br>
> Summarize, cross-tabulate, transpose, and reformat data to prepare a dataset for analysis. </br>
> Join and union data from different sources and formats. </br>

### Project 3: Creditworthiness: Predicting Default Risk
Learnings:

> Understand the fundamentals of classification modeling and how it differs from modeling numeric data. </br>
> Build logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and boosted models; use stepwise to automate predictor variables selection. </br>
> Score and compare models and interpret the results. </br>


### Project 4: A/B Test a New Menu Launch

A chain of coffee shops is considering launching a new menu. Design and analyze an A/B test and write up a recommendation on whether the chain should introduce the new menu.

Learnings:

> Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including selecting target and control units and variables and the duration of a test. </br>
> Randomized design : select test and control variables and understand the importance of sample size and design a randomized design A/B test and analyze the results. </br>
> Matched Pair design : match test units to control units and design a matched pair design A/B test and analyze the results. </br>


### Capstone Project: Segmentation and Clustering

A grocery store chain is planning a significant expansion. Use multiple analytical techniques to provide recommendations on how to expand.

- Capstone Project: Predictive Analytics Capstone

Learnings:

> Segmentation basics: understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. </br>
> Preparing data: scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling and select variables to include based on the business context.</br>
> Variable Reduction: use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model.</br>
> Clustering models: select the appropriate number of clusters; build and apply a k-centroid cluster model.</br>
> Comfortable combining predictive techniques and delivering results to complex business problems.</br>
